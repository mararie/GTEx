## Gene regulatory networks for 38 GTEx tissues ##
This repository contains code to reconstruct gene regulatory networks for 38 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx), using RNA-Seq data from GTEx normalized with YARN (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/yarn.html).
